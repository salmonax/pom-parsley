PomParsley
=========
A custom timesheet parser, inspired by the Pomodoro Technique 

## Requirements
  `Node >= 4.45`

## Installation
  `npm install pom-parsley`

## Usage
  ```
  var pomParsley = require('pom-parsley');
  pomParsley('10/10/2010\n 10 Did cool things'); //=> a stats object
  ```

## Tests
  `npm test`

## How the System Works

Here are an example of tag definitions, used for organizing broad "areas of focus":

    C Coding and Tools-related
    R Rails and Ruby (Reading/Coding/Testing)
    D Desktop Power-user
    F Friendship (Requested/Proactive)
    W Front-end Web Development

    ! Milestone
    ^ De-procrastination (Lapse/Hiatus)
    & Practical (Proactive/Urgent)
    ~ Waffling Obsession (Obstacular/Malingering)

And here is an example of a busy day with the pomsheet:

    5/21/2014

    0.5 &WW^ Workthrough: SEL Html 5 -> 29% X
    1.5 & Renoise: read forums on secondary highlighting, 3.0 release notes X
    3 &E Read: The Launchpad -> 22% X
    3.5 &DD Virtualization: get VMware running Windows 7, troubleshoot lack of 3D support  X
    4 &DD Virtualization: noodle through driver issues, add PPA's and try to install drivers X
    5 &DD! Virtualization: enable SNA, abandon VMware, test Space Shooter in Chrome, better! X

    6 &RR Opal: see how D3 class works again, continue animation chaining     X
    7 &RR Opal: get animation chaining to work ala tutorial! Try imitating #on behavior X
    8 &RR! Opal: fix animation chaining in functionless condition, try mixed chaining   X
    8.5 &RR Opal: ponder when to toggle on_branch_already, relent on mixed, remove debug lines X
    9 ~W Opal: start binding example, question wrapper viability while looking at docs  X

    10.5  &^ Fiction Read: Snowcrash -> 60 X

    20.5  &CCF Scala: Install Eclipse, get "Hello World" to compile and worksheet output    X
    21  &CCF Scala: work through the example tutorial and figure out how to import projects X
    21.5  &CF Scala: get tests running in Eclipse, work through b-tree X 

    22  &DD Scala: fix swap partition, verify sbt and Eclipse will run simultaneously  X
    22.5  &D Ubuntu: read about keyring issue, try a few things, delete the damn thing  X   

Dates get their own line, written in M/D/YYYY format.

The task lines have the following properties:

- The number at the beginning of each line is the time, estimated to the nearest half-hour. For example, 6:30pm would be written as "18.5", 8am would be written as "8". This is the time at which a session of pomodoros is FINISHED.
- The time is optionally followed by a short tag (eg. "&CCF"). By convention, symbol tags delineate momentum and motivation tags (eg. "Waffling Obsession" for "~") while letters delineate subject areas. Also by convention, single letter tags denote input, double letters denote output. For example, "R" would typically mean reading about Ruby, "RR" would mean programming in Ruby. Tags can be whatever you want.
- The single-letter tag is optionally followed by a category definition  (ie. "Scala" or "Opal"), a description of the task, and the number of poms spent on the task.
- A hash rocket can be affixed to names of books to indicate the position the last page read during a pom session.

## Contributing

You probably don't actually want to contribute to this. At some point, I'll rewrite it properly and document the output format. For the time being, it's kind of a one-off for a timesheet that I still happen to use.
